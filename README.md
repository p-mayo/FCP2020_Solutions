# Solutions to the worksheets of FCP
Example solutions for the exercises for the unit Further Computer Programming, at the University of Bristol. The content of the unit can be found [here](https://engmaths.github.io/emat10006/)

## Week 1
Week 1 was about getting familiar with the command line/terminal and starting using python from it.

The exercise consisted in creating a program that would compute some stats on the arguments passed through the command line.

- averages.py

## Week 2
No exercises -- this week consisted in the use of GitHub. The task was to create an account and share it with the TA

## Week 3
Getting familiar with pytest and improving the way functions are implemented. The task involved fixing some of the scripts and adding some additional tests for one of them.

Files:
- cube.py
- det.py (this is the one done during the tutorial session)
- det_solution.py
- factorial.py
- myscript.py
- roots.py (done during the tutorial session)
- roots_solution.py
- square.py

## Week 4
You will notice the Week 4 content is there, however, these are the scripts already present in the content of the unit.

In this week, you will have to play a bit with push and pull commands as well as the features found within the matplotlib/numpy modules.

## Additional Resources
### Extra content on classes
I have uploaded an example script that contains a class MyFraction. 

### Markdown
If you'd like to format better your README.md file, it is done using the Markdown language, [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) is a cheatsheet and [here](https://stackedit.io/) is a web editor in case you'd like to try it out before commiting the changes to GitHub.
